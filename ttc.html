				<p>
				The Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) is staple of the city of Toronto. But their website presents a major information overload situation that many users don't even know where to begin. I decided to personally challenge myself and my abilities to problem solve and come up with creative solutions.
				</p>
				<p>
				As a fellow Torontonian, I feel the distress, confusion, and frustration when we're trying to get where we need to be, but we don't know where to find it. I used this as a motivation, a resource, and driving force for this redesign approach.

			<h3>Research</h3>

					<div class="column">
							<h4>What do People Look for about the TTC</h4>
							<p>These were the top searches according to Toronto Metro for 2016:
								<h5>Questions from Torontonians about the TTC in the past six months</h5>
								<ol>
									<li>How to plan a TTC trip?</li>
									<li>How much is a TTC fare?</li>
									<li>What time does the TTC open?</li>
									<li>What does the TTC stand for?</li>
									<li>How many people does the TTC employ?</li>
									<li>How much does a TTC driver make?</li>
									<li>How does Presto work?</li>
									<li>How many people ride the TTC?</li>
									<li>Where is the TTC lost and found?</li>
								</ol>
							</p>

							<p>
								<h5>Questions about TTC subways, streetcars, and buses</h5>
									<ol>
										<li>Where is my streetcar?</li>
										<li>When is the next TTC bus?</li>
										<li>Is the Spadina streetcar 24 hours?</li>
										<li>What time do the subways run on Saturday?</li>
										<li>How to become a TTC us driver?</li>
										<li>Why do TTC buses short turn?</li>
										<li>How to place a bike on a bus rack?</li>
										<li>Why does the Bathurst streetcar track have sand in it?</li>
										<li>How much did the new streetcars cost?</li>
										<li>WHat is the TTC policy on lowering the step?</li>
									</ol>
								</p>

								<p><h5> And using Google, top search queries for Ontario, Canada with the keyword "ttc":</h5>
									<ol>
										<li>ttc subway</li>
										<li>ttc map</li>
										<li>ttc bus</li>
										<li>ttc toronto</li>
										<li>subway ttc map</li>

										<li>presto</li>
										<li>ttc pass</li>
										<li>ttc planner</li>
									</ol>

									<h4>"Competitive Research"</h4>
									<p>I also took a look at other efficient transit systems from around the world and their main navigation menus:
										<h5>Tokyo Metro</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Tips for Using Tokyo Metro</li>
												<li>Subway Map</li>
												<li>Fares/Tickets/Passes</li>
												<li>Popular Attractions</li>
											</ol>

										<h5>Transport for London</h5>
											<ol>
												<li>Plan a Journey</li>
												<li>Status Updates</li>
												<li>Maps</li>
												<li>Fare & Payments</li>
												<li>Help & Contact</li>
											</ol>

										<h5>Korean Transporation</h5>
											<ol>
													<li>Routes</li>
													<li>Timetables</li>
													<li>Fares</li>
												</ol>

						<h3>Process</h3>
							<div class="flex-container">
								<div class="column">
										<h4>Goals</h4>
										<p>I narrowed down to three main goals along with the personas I have made:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>Show how to get directions to destination</li>
												<li>Show when the next streetcar/bus/train is</li>
												<li>Be able to find how much TTC fare is</li>
											</ol>

							<h4>Sitemap</h4>
								<div class="flex-container">

									<div class="column">
										<p>The approach here was to encourage users to use search as much as possible because of how much content the website actually has. For example, when you're looking for Union Station, what about Union Station are you looking for - it can be price, it can be when the next train is, it can be if it's delayed or whatnot. I also included popular destinations up at the top to give first time visitors a path to start from. When I was visiting other transit websites for the London Tube for example, I had absolutely not clue where to start and where to go even though there was a trip planner right at my face. Because of how overwhelmed I became, I dropped off the website pretty quickly. I also focused on minimizing the amount of clicks (maximum of 4 clicks) to take into considerationg those who are in a rush or in time-sensitive situations.</p>

					<h4>Attempt #1 Prototype</h4>
						<div class="flex-container">
							<div class="column">
								<p>Using Adobe XD, I wireframed and prototyped my first attempt at the redesign. I also used Canvasflip to create a user-task test to test the information architecture of my prototype.
								</p>
								<h5>My Findings (From 3 Users)</h5>
									<ul>
										<li>Everyone has a different mental models of what "Maps" would contain - one clicked to find a station and another clicked on it for a bus schedule</li>
										<li>Fare prices was very easy to find (average of 5.3 seconds to get there)</li>
										<li>"Operating Close to You" isn't very obvious. It could be because it's too wordy or not prominent enough</li>
										<li>It could also be because the wireframes were not polished enough. Nobody clicked on the top right icon because it was just a white rectangle and nobody knew what it did</li>
									</ul>

					<h4>Attempt #2 Prototype</h4>
						<div class="flex-container">
								<div class="column">
									<p>I decided to take another stab at it using Figma. I took a slightly different approach in the information architecture, by taking out "Attractions" and replacing it with "Schedules." I also put in categories for the 4 main navigation buttons. For example, if you click on "Maps" it would show what kind of maps (subway/streetcar/bus) and a list of popular tourist attractions for vacationers. Essentially I sacrificed a some breadth for more depth to accommodate various mental models.
									</p>

									<h5>My Findings <From 2 Users></h5>
										<ul>
											<li>Time took longer on average, but completion rate was higher<li>
										</ul>
